excerpt: "The Tapscott Lab focuses on gene transcription in a chromatin context in 
          normal development and disease. The lab uses the myogenic transcription factor MyoD to study how complex programs of gene expression unfold during cell differentiation. In addition, the lab studies gene expression in rhabdomysarcomas (cancers with characteristics of skeletal muscle) and human muscular dystrophies."

    excerpt: "Hope for patients with a common muscular dystrophy - FSHD and other muscular dystrophies have proven to be extremely confounding for biomedical researchers, yielding so little information that the very idea of coming up with drugs to treat them has seemed like a dream."
