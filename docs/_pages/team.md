    title: Stephen Tapscott, MD, Ph.D. <br />  <small> Principal Investigator </small>
    excerpt: "Dr. Tapscott obtained an MD and PhD degree from the University of Pennsylvania, where he also completed medical internship and neurology residency. He completed postdoctoral studies with Dr. Harold Weintraub at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, where he is currently a Member in the Divisions of Human Biology and Clinical Research, and a Professor of Neurology at the University of Washington. His research focuses on the regulation of gene expression during cell differentiation using myogenesis and neurogenesis as model systems. In addition, his lab has active programs in the role of triplet and macrosatellite repeats in the genome, epigenetic regulation in development and in cancer, and cellular and genetic therapies for muscular dystrophies. Dr. Tapscott serves on the scientific advisory boards of the American Brain Tumor Association and the Max Planck Institute Bad Nauheim in Germany. He is also an Advisory Council Member at the National Institute of Arthritis, Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases and on the Editorial Boards of of Developmental Cell and Muscle & Nerve."

    title: "Amy Campbell, Ph.D. <br /><small> Staff Scientist </small>"
    excerpt: Staff Scientist. Amy received a B.A. in Biology from Reed College and a Ph.D. in Cell and Molecular Biology from the University of Pennsylvania, where she studied genetic and epigenetic control of hematopoiesis with Dr. Gerd Blobel. She joined the Tapscott lab in 2013 as a postdoctoral research fellow to investigate DUX4 regulation and function, and to identify therapeutic targets for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). Amy continues to study DUX4 and FSHD biology as a staff scientist, and is also responsible for day-to-day management of the Tapscott lab.

     title: "Amy Spens <br />  <small> Graduate Research Assistant  </small>"
     excerpt: "Amy received her BA in Biology and Anthropology from Bowdoin College and worked at Fred Hutch for 2 years before joining UW's Molecular and Cellular Biology PhD program in 2017. She is most interested in the regulation of DUX4 and the mechanism by which DUX4 modulates cells' immune responses. When not in lab she loves to bike, kayak, and hammock her way throughout Seattle."
